title: Keeping a Clean Git History
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Recently I've taken to reading more about git. The problem I've run into is that we have so many developers at work changing the same projects that it's become a chore to figure out what went wrong when I merge my topic branch back into master. I've found many different articles on keeping a clean git history. I've decided to take what I've learned and condense it into one article for me and possibly the dev team I work with to use. I've posted a list of links to the articles I learned from at the bottom of this page.

title: Command Line Find and Replace
---

I found a bunch of different websites telling me how to do a find and replace with sed but I kept getting this error:
    "unterminated substitute in regular expression"

I finally figured out that a sed command written like this:
    sed -i "s/ version='3.1'//g" somefile.rb
wouldn't work since the -i switch is looking for an extension. Here's exactly what was happening:
  the -i switch thought the regex I was giving was the extension
  the file I was passing in was being mistaken for a regex

Here's the command that actually works:
  sed -i '' "s/ version='3.1'//g" file

And just for fun, here's how to search and replace within a directory of files using just the command line:
  find spec/lib/mdx/mdx3/version1/ -type f -exec sed -i '' "s/ version='3.1'//g" {} \;

Since sed doesn't handle newlines that easily, I used perl to remove a certain tag that had a newline in it:
  find spec/lib/clients/mdx/ -type f -exec perl -i -p -e 's/\\n  <version>3.4<\/version>//g' {} \;

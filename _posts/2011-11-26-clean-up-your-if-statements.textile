title: Clean Up Your If Statements

{{ page.title }}
================


If you're like me, you've seen thousands of if statements, some messy, some pretty clean. Sometimes you come across a situation that requires a hideous if statement, like the one below (contrived)

If you're like most people, you'll look at that statement and think "I'll come back to this if I need to". It's not something most people take the time to try and figure out. Fortunately, there's a much c!eaner way to write this. Storing some of the conditions in variables will simplify the statement and make it more readable

I'm betting you understood the second example a lot quicker than the first. It's much easier to read clearly separated boolean statements than it is to traverse through a mess of them.


Go forth and code cleanly, child.
